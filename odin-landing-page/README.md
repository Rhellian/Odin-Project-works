First CSS project for The Odin Project.
<br>
<br>
Post-project notes:
<p>A lot more work involved than the first HTML project, got about 90% through then opted to stop due to personal time constraints.</p>
<p>The project was still very helpful for understanding the workflow in building a full featured webpage from scratch.</p>
